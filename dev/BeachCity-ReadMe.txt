Hi, I migrated the BeachCity to Lumberyard 1.15, which I am ready to share.
I contacted support team, Walters Gene suggested me to give a pull request.
I actually tried to raise an issue to discuss about this but there is no issues tab.
So, I did this dummy PR, I think merging BeachCity in Lumberyard makes larger, so if you think it to be seperate, I am even ready to share it via any cloud, like GoogleDrive.
If you think its almost done, you can BeachCity when Lumberyard 1.16 is released.

Thanks.
